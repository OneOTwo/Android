## Usage
If you are building a new project, directly to the entire project **clone** (or download), as **Demo** as the main module, then the package name into their own package name , **Demo** contains the package structure can be used directly, a mainstream `MVP` +` Dagger2` + `Retrofit` +` Rxjava` framework so easy to build successful, and now you refer **Demo Mvp** Package under the **UserActivity** format,Use Template to automatically generate MVP, Dagger2 related classes under the corresponding package, with access to [Wiki documents](https://github.com/smuwjs/android-mvp-architecture/wiki).
